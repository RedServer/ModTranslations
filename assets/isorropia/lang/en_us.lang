research.ARCANELENSES.title=Arcane Lenses Theory
research.ARCANELENSES.stage.1.text=The Goggles of Revealing that I wear are quite dandy, but after a while, they seem a little more mundane than they should be.<BR>I can do better than that! After all, there is more than meets the eye! Using special lenses, I should be able to add powers of perception to my Goggles of Revealing.<BR>And because I have two eyes, two new lenses should be able to fit at once.
research.ARCANELENSES.stage.2.text=The basic lens is now done. Salis Mundus and Gold can do real wonders on a simple piece of glass.<BR>It does not disturb the function of the goggles and still has enough potency to go into other directions.<BR>It is time to investigate where I can take this.<BR>The new lens seems to react nicely around elemental crystals.
#
research.FIRELENS.title=Heinrich's Lens
research.FIRELENS.stage.1.text=If I hold an Ignis crystal, a basic lense and my Goggles of Revealing in one straight line, it becomes a bit brighter.<BR>It is time to see what fire can do.
research.FIRELENS.stage.2.text=The light amplifying powers of fire, when viewed through the lens, are miraculous. But also dangerous.<BR>An incorrect calibration or forgetting to limit how bright the lens can get could have catastrophic results on my eyes!<BR>It seems I need to study rays of light to calibrate it correctly.
research.FIRELENS.stage.3.text=Thanks to the proper implementation of the power that the element of fire yields, I have perfected the lens.<BR>Now I can see the light even in absolute darkness.<BR>But I won't get blinded when staring at something that's a bit brighter than a deep abyss.<BR>The Heinrich's Lens has only one weakness: Water.<BR>It cannot function beneath the waves due to the nature of fire.<BR>It seems I can't have everything.
#
research.ORDOLENS.title=Scholar's Lens
research.ORDOLENS.stage.1.text=I always resented the fact that the Thaumometer's ability to scan everything before it got lost when crafted into the Goggles of Revealing.<BR>But now that I can craft exciting lenses with varied functions, this does not have to be the case for much longer.<BR>After all, the reason why it doesn't work is a simple issue of chaotic resonance that gets created when two Thaumometers are linked directly adjacent to another.<BR>Nothing that a little order can't fix!
research.ORDOLENS.stage.2.text=As I have suspected, simply combining the aspect of order with a lens and laying it above the glass of the embedded Thaumometer in my goggles has countered the chaos and nullified the resonance issue.<BR>Now I can finally scan everything in sight and even see the aspects of every creature before me.
#
research.AIRLENS.title=Kirlian Lens
research.AIRLENS.stage.1.text=It seems that the presence of life and death have a minuscule effect on the local aura.<BR>It isn't anywhere close to have a useful effect in buffing or debuffing the aura, but it can be detected.<BR>Thanks to the lenses, I might be able to reverse engineer that phenomenon into a lens that can let me see the ripples each one creates!<BR>And it seems that air is the element for the job!
research.AIRLENS.stage.2.text=It was easier than imagined, but I have managed to reverse engineer the ripple effect into a visible state thanks to the power of air.<BR>The ripples of a living creature are a pleasant blue.<BR>As expected, Undeath as a presence is different and I can see it as a detestable vortex of red.<BR>I wasn't certain whether or not the Eldritch make ripples in the first place, nor if I should look at them without fearing for my sanity.<BR>Luckily, they do and luckily I don't have to fear. They can be detected by my brave lens in a shrieking maelstrom of malicious purple.<BR>Or maybe I do have to fear.
#
research.ENVYLENS.title=Trickster's Lens
research.ENVYLENS.stage.1.text=Invidia is greedy enough to get a lens of it's own it seems!<BR>Or at least the lens reacts to the presence of Invidia.<BR>I sense that I will enjoy the product of this experiment.
research.ENVYLENS.stage.2.text=It is a miracle! Thanks to the Trickster's Lens I can steal whatever a creature would drop upon death!<BR>But not only do I get the precious resources of the mob, but I can still kill it for even more goodies!<BR>I simply need to be a bit sneaky about pickpocketing what I desire.<BR>The only downside is that the more vitality a mob possesses, the longer it takes to rid them of their precious material.
#
research.HANGINGLABEL.title=Adherent Label
research.HANGINGLABEL.stage.1.text=The labels on my jars are nice and all, but sometimes my sorting could do with a little more pizzazz!<BR>That ol' razzle dazzle could be achieved easily with some labels that stick to anything.<BR>And now I have the Adherent Label, that I can put on anything I see fit!
#
research.SOMATICBRAIN.title=Somatic Brain
research.SOMATICBRAIN.stage.1.text=This is my problem: I need more Experience Points for the same effort and an easier time with my research...<BR>This is my solution: I will pimp a zombie brain onto my own noggin!
research.SOMATICBRAIN.stage.2.text=After one measly sacrifice, I have found a way to wear a zombie brain on top of my own without the need to even pimp the both together - and now both brains receive the little yellow balls of Experience, yet the extra brain sends the ones it has back to me!<BR>The help it provides for my research is simple. If I think hard enough, the brain "steals" some of my thoughts, thinks them itself and returns them in a finished form back to me.<BR>The help it provides for my research is simple. If I think hard enough, the brain "steals" some of my thoughts, thinks them itself and returns them in a finished form back to me.<BR>That helps make my own head free for more thinking and therefore more revelation from observation and theory.<BR>In total, I get twice as much experience and a swell research aide for the price of wearing a silly and possibly malevolent hat.<BR>A good trade.
#
research.CURATIVEVAT.title=Curative Vat
research.CURATIVEVAT.stage.1.text=There is a problem. A problem that is quite scary if you allow yourself to think it through.<BR>Taint might not be everywhere, but Flux is. It comes from basically everything and there is close to no way to completely avoid it.<PAGE>From Flux arises Taint, from Taint, you get poisoned and from Taint Poison, there comes corruption.<BR>I have seen it only in animals until now, but I still have to fear for my own live, for there does not seem to be any cure other than the cold embrace of death.<BR>This problem must be fixed. Normal healing does not seem potent enough, so a stronger means of healing must be created and I shall rise to the challenge!<BR>To properly meddle with something, I first need to understand it, so the first step must be to compare normal tissue and tainted tissue, so that I may understand the difference. 
research.CURATIVEVAT.stage.2.text=Now that I have discovered the difference, I can start finding ways to annihilate the change and return the corrupted flesh back into the living counterpart that I desire to have and keep.<BR>Ironically enough, there already is a means to healing corruption, even if it is not about taint, I should still be able to draw reference from it and find parallels between the two.<BR>It's time to find a zombie villager.
research.CURATIVEVAT.stage.3.text=It is time! Now all the pieces of the puzzle lay in front of me and I simply need to piece them all together.<BR>Just like most potions start by adding something into an awkward potion, I need to apply essentia to a special liquid too.<BR>Unfortunately, unlike potions, the essentia cannot be swallowed without detrimental consequences, even despite that special liquid and the liquid needs to reach everywhere.<BR>This means that one needs to be submerged into the liquid and it needs to have a steady influx of fresh air that will be absorbed thanks to the liquid, just like the essentia.<BR>Now that I understand how to do it, I simply need to create a device capable catering to every need that a submerged lifeform (or similar) might need.
research.CURATIVEVAT.stage.4.text=Finally, the Curative Vat has been finished. It was quite a piece of work, but it will be worth it!<BR>To use it, I simply have to open the hatch at the top and step in.<BR>I can heal myself easily using Victus Essentia and a little bit of time. Thanks to the influx of air, I have all the time in the world and don't even need to use my lungs!<BR>And I can even eradicate pesky hunger using Fames Essentia, which is quite dandy for when I am sick of eating half-moldy bread for the 17th time in a row!<BR>Finally, my magnum opus of this operation: The cure of taint corruption.<BR>Ignis is the essentia for the job for it kills the taint and eradicates what plagues a corrupted mob. But it will still take a good bit of essentia to do it. One phial is probably not enough.<BR>Unfortunately, I can't "cure" a mob that is pure taint and Ignis will simply damage it until death.<BR>But that can have a use of it's own!<BR>The only remaining problem is that no creature other than myself is keen on getting into the vat ...<BR>Good thing that I have designed the vat with future compatibility in mind. Even though I am glad that I have finished it, this should not be the end for my glorious creation!
#
research.CONTAINMENT.title=Focus Effect: Containment
research.CONTAINMENT.stage.1.text=In this world, there are many exotic creatures that warrant further study.<BR>Yet I must find a way to bring them back to my laboratory, that is less tedious than hauling them around the world, attached to a leash!<BR>Through Foci, I am able to make holes in reality, heal myself and many more wondrous things, so surely, a focus will be my salvation on this vexing matter.<BR>The most simple solution would be to simply glue the creature to my back, but hopefully converting the Rift effect will enable me to store my target.
research.CONTAINMENT.stage.2.text=After a lot of tests I have indeed managed to convert the Rift effect into a displacement charm.<BR>The Containment Effect can place a mob, a monster and even more complex creatures such as a villager or a guardian in a jar and puts them in stasis for their stay in the jar. Strangely enough, the effect cannot scoop up another player. Despite of how odd this is, it might be for the best.<BR>How difficult anything is to put in a jar depends on how healthy it is. If you bring a villager near death, it will be easier to catch than an untouched chicken, but without harm done the chicken would be caught much easier.<BR>Unfortunately though, only the Warded Jar was suitable for the imprisonment of my subjects. It may be a bit pricey, but it will still be worth every last bit of Vis!
#
research.CREATUREINFUSIONS.title=Creature Infusions
research.CREATUREINFUSIONS.stage.1.text=Thanks to my Containment Foci, I can finally capture creatures and put them into my vat.<BR>But to only use it to heal an infected villager, that has mistaken a zombie for a friendly visitor again seems like a waste.<BR>But what can one do to remedy that?<PAGE>One mad idea comes to my mind: The infusion of creatures.<LINE>Ancient Tomes of Thaumaturgy, where wands are mentioned, also mention that the infusion of something alive is madness that can only end in hideous deformities and suffering.<BR>But some texts tell of rumors, that a living being might be infusable, if they were to willingly step into an apparatus and fall into a coma-like state.<BR>The new matrix will have to deal with that and make all subjects comatose.<BR>Perhaps infusing a creature will finally be possible. But there is much to do and much to research.<BR>First of all, I need to create a specialized infusion matrix, that fits atop the curative vat. It will block the access to the chamber, but I don't think that anybody would want to interrupt an ongoing infusion by using their own body as a foreign object and risk mutilation and suffering.
research.CREATUREINFUSIONS.stage.2.text=Turns out that to create the new infusion matrix, I need to infuse a matrix.<BR>A little bit of blood is enough to attune the matrix towards living matter, but I fear the matrix may become somewhat alive too. It won't even be as much alive as a tree, but every little bit of life can be killed, so an infusion that goes completely wrong could end up annihilating the matrix.<BR>Furthermore, the presence of a second matrix generates generous amounts of instability, for the two matrices will generate arcane feedback between another.<BR>But once that is done, the dawn of a new era will be upon me.<LINE>Infusing myself is another problem entirely, for if I am not around, whom could I trust to make sure the infusion of my own body will go off without a hitch? And automating the process seems like an even worse idea.<BR>But for now I should limit myself to the infusion of creatures. One step at a time, I will conquer life itself!
research.CREATUREINFUSIONS.stage.3.text=Good. Now that I have created the new matrix, I should write down the exact way to use it, in case the warp annihilates my memories one day.<BR>The matrix is to be placed directly above the hatch.<BR>The Curative Vat is best placed on an even surface. On that surface, the altars are to be placed.<BR>Don't forget to insert the subject. It the liquid, now modified through the matrix, will put it into a coma-sleep almost instantly. Admittedly, I myself don't fall into a coma as easily and I'm always fully aware of everything that goes on around me. But any animal, undead, villager and everything in between will fall into become awfully calm once placed in the vat, with only some nervous twitches every now and again.<BR>The Essentia for each infusion needs to be pumped into the vat, or delivered via transfusers.<LINE>Just like a normal infusion, occult paraphernalia and symmetry need to be present to work against the instability.<BR>Future-Me, if you're reading this and have no idea what I wrote, then I'd suggest you give the Infusion entry another read.<BR>However, there is a new problem with the new matrix. Flux does not get released. That matrix seems to eat it up!<BR>And once it cannot take anymore, instead of expulsing the taint, the vat itself shatters under the dirty pressure of the matrix!<BR>During an ongoing infusion, it is would be a bad idea to release it. But it CAN be released!<BR>After an infusion, the stored taint is very simply coughed up after while crouching and with my trusty old gauntlet.<BR>I should only start the infusion, once the infusion setup, the recipe, the amount of essentia and the correct workings have been checked thoroughly, for a failure will result in terrible consequences.<BR>Unlike me previous assumption, the matrix itself will not be the victim, but the poor subject, who was meant to be infused will die in an ugly manner.<BR>A little tip with a gauntlet will initiate the process.<BR>Many infusions should be easy. And for now, I'll tend to the easy ones first, so that I can build an understanding of creature infusions for more advanced ones.<BR>That why I have designed a basic set of infusion which focus on increasing the attributes of living beings<BR>These infusions can be applied on every creature under the sun.<PAGE>§nQuicksilver Limbs§r:<BR>With this upgrade, the limbs of a creature are filled with a mix of Mercury and a Potion of Swiftness, that allows the limbs to keep producing the potion to circulate through the entire body, allowing the infused being to be more swift.<PAGE>§nThaumium Blades§r:<BR>Giving a creature this infusion will give the creature a bladed, Thaumium upgrade to their means of attack. The infusion will miraculously attach itself to teeth, claws, tail or whatever else the creature may wish to use for means of attack, without any outside guidance!<PAGE>§nDiamond Skin§r:<BR>Infusing the Skin with metal will slowly poison a creature, due to the fact that the skin is a vital organ and metal is foreign to the biology of a normal creature. Therefore, everything that is not made of a non-living material would suffer.<BR>A remedy to that problem is Diamond, for it is also made of carbon, just like the skin itself and will not poison the my living creation from the inside out.<PAGE>§nShockskin§r:<BR>Redstone works marvelously. Redstone- and Quartz glands all over the skin work in symbiosis. If the redstone glands send a signal of a major impact, the quartz glands will catch it and turn it into an electric shock, harming the idiot who dared punch my new pet!<BR>My fears for this process to harm the creature itself were unfounded. For some reason, the skin acts as armour itself, conducting the electricity away from the valuable insides of the infused being.<BR>It would only become a problem if the creature were to suddenly develop a taste for it's own limbs.<PAGE>§nMiracle Blood§r:<BR>My blood can slowly heal my wounds from the inside, if I'm well enough fed. An animal lacks that ability. Instead of trying to find out why that quirk is and fixing it, taking my own blood and infusing it into the creature has yielded the result I wanted.<PAGE>§nPortability§r:<BR>Your containment focus is invaluable, but the process of jarring and releasing a creature can be costly in both glass and Vis. Now there is a potentially more efficient alternative.<BR>Your §5Portability§0 infusion places a jar around the creature and displaces it slightly in higher dimensions. One tap of your wand can pull it back onto the material plane, trapping the creature; another releases the beast and shifts the jar back to the void, where it reassembles itself for future use.
#
research.SPECIEINFUSIONS.title=Specie Infusions
research.SPECIEINFUSIONS.stage.1.text=For now I have only dabbled in Infusions that every creature under the sun/moon can have applied to it.<LINE>But it is time to move on to research and exploit specific creatures on their own.<BR>Many species will have their own sets of infusions. Ideas for such include making a chicken lay an egg of gold, creating a sheep that changes colors and a way to create the mythical Mooshroom without having to find the fungal islands where they reside.<BR>Naturally, these infusions are tailored exploit the specific characteristics of a mob and cannot be applied anywhere else. Meaning, I can't give the Gold Egg infusion to a wolf, for a wolf does not lay eggs.
#
research.OREBOAR.title=Ore Boar
research.OREBOAR.stage.1.text=Most farmers regard pigs as nothing more than walking meat with extravagant taste.<BR>But a thaumaturge knows better. The ravenous hunger of a pig can be used to my advantage.<BR>This sultry sow wants to eat and I have lots of cobblestone clogging up my chests and containers.<PAGE><LINE>If I want to combine the two, I need to find out how to turn a pigs stomach into a blazing inferno of a heat that makes a furnace look inferior in comparison. All of that, naturally, without smoking the poor little thing.
research.OREBOAR.stage.2.text=My newest stony boar, the Ore Pig, is capable of eating cobblestone, finding trace metals inside of it and ignoring said minerals inside of it's stomach, so I can happily keep an eye on the pig until metal nuggets appear! Such joy...<BR><LINE>As with any creature, the Ore Pig has a certain taste and a favorite ore. It will find that metal more often than others.<PAGE>Lastly, only things that can be turned into nuggets (and dust) can be found by the pig.<BR>The scholar chickens are still debating, whether or not that stony boar can find coal.
#
research.TAINTFEEDER.title=Taintfeeder
research.TAINTFEEDER.stage.1.text=Pigs eat. They gorge themselves on food if they can. They greedily seek out their food and consume it.<BR>The best use for such a creature would be as a trashcan. But as a thaumaturge, who has utter control over life itself, a pig will serve me better than just eat my semi-rotten food.<PAGE><LINE>Taint is always a problem, it comes from when a thaumaturge messes up, is careless or generally via distilling some essentia.<BR>But if I can create a symbiotic relationship between taint and a pig, the pig will start to consume the taint off the very blocks it's on.
research.TAINTFEEDER.stage.2.text=It is done, the pig to end all taint!<LINE>The Taintfeeder will consume all of the tainted blocks and leave them to their original state. It eats the taint with greed and hunger, without harming anything else, itself included.<LINE>Now I can only imagine how people would look at me if I come to their tainted mess, bearing a pig that cleans up their base.
#
research.SCHOLARSCHICKEN.title=Scholar's Chicken
research.SCHOLARSCHICKEN.stage.1.text=I have seen many Thaumaturges dive deep and long for squids, day in, day out. And despite the fact that I'd encourage the slaughter of the awkward water-cubes, I can't help myself and tire of it.<LINE>The other animal, that Thaumaturges seem to have a need for is the chicken, for it gives us the feathers we need to use as quills.<PAGE>Now I will make the squid obsolete once again, by changing a chicken into the only animal, that a thaumaturge will need.
research.SCHOLARSCHICKEN.stage.2.text=Make way for the Scholar's Chicken! This little miracle will not just lay eggs with abysmally black egg yolks, which are perfect as ink and don't spoil, it also sheds big feathers often, so that one never runs out of them. Also, arrows are now easier to craft!<BR>A win-win for everyone, but the squid.
#
research.CHROMATICSHEEP.title=Chomatic Sheep
research.CHROMATICSHEEP.stage.1.text=It is time to get rid of the need to color a sheep before I can gather the wool I want!<BR>For this I simply need to express some interest in colors, or more accurately, in the change of colors.<BR>My sheep will never be boring again, I just need a little bit of research.
research.CHROMATICSHEEP.stage.2.text=After some simple tests I have found out how to make an awesome sheep that shines in all colors of the rainbow.<BR>However, the wool itself looses the ability to change color once it gets disconnected from the sheep and then it is stuck on the color that it ended on.
#
research.JELLYRABBIT.title=Jelly Rabbit
research.JELLYRABBIT.stage.1.text=The rabbit is a nice little creature. Swift as the wind, with meat that melts on your tongue and have very nice fur!<BR>But in the arcane department, there is little use for the rabbit. However, one of those uses might just be everything I'd want from a leporidious friend.<PAGE>During one of my observations and studies, one of the rabbits who seemed bored decided to chew one of my crystals.<BR>These animals are stupid enough to put their lives in danger just because they are bored. However its characteristics inspire me for a new infusion.<LINE>Jelly. An odd material. Some use it for food. But I have a better idea for it. Jelly can contain things and taking inspiration from a slime, it can be alive too.<BR>Alas, a slime does not grow, but only split into parts. But that can be remedied by applying it to a wee little rabbit!<BR>But what could be contained in said jelly? Simple: Essentia of a certain aspect. Cultivated and grown, to harvest at my leisure.
research.JELLYRABBIT.stage.2.text=The Jelly Rabbit is the culmination of what a rabbit can achieve. It is made of jelly and has a thing layer of a similar jelly growing on it.<BR>This layer will grow for many stages and is ready to be harvested after the first grow. Giving the rabbit a simple smack or using shears on it will release the layer from the rabbit.<BR>The rabbit is also immune to the damage of a good smack, as long as it still has at least one layer. The type of aspect, that the jelly holds, is based on the aspect of the crystal used in the infusion.<BR>However, the layers grow by absorbing Vis out of the aura, so any ideas of having over nine thousand of these little aspect growers fall flatter than a flounder.
#
research.GRAVEKEEPERINFUSIONS.title=Gravekeeper
research.GRAVEKEEPERINFUSIONS.stage.1.text=I have heard strange tales about ancient civilizations that revered cats for their link to the underworld.<BR>And it truly seems like Mortuus Essentia reacts almost calm in the presence of cats, while Exanimis seems to try and dissolve itself.<BR>Now that I have mastered Creature Infusion, I should be able to not just find the truth of these tales, but to draw it out and use it for myself.
research.GRAVEKEEPERINFUSIONS.stage.2.text=My first test subject may have aged visibly with every second due to a little imperfection in my local aura (note to self: Only use this infusion by day).<BR>I have learned everything I could want about the Grave Keeper, including how to make a proper one!<LINE>This adorable little feline immolates the undead by casting a strange glowing ray upon them.<PAGE>Interestingly, only the smartest of the undead nasties actually try to avoid this cat and the rest seem to be unable to even detect it.
#
research.GUARDIANPANTHER.title=Guardian Panther
research.GUARDIANPANTHER.stage.1.text=Your cats make fine companions, but with a few tweaks they could also be put to more practical uses.
research.GUARDIANPANTHER.stage.2.text=The first such infusion you have discovered radically increases a house cat's size, resulting in a human-sized animal which retains its feline grace and power. By overstimulating its bonding instinct you have also instilled ferocious loyalty in the resulting panther. It will now defend you much like a tamed wolf, although it is faster and stronger. Creepers retain their fear of cats regardless of size.
#
research.SIMILITUDOINFUSIONS.title=Similitudo Infusions
research.SIMILITUDOINFUSIONS.stage.1.text=Unlike Infusions that work on everything and infusions that only apply to one certain creatures, those that target a specific set of creatures, that all share similarities, are plenty pesterful.<BR>Why? Simple: I need to find out said similarities and differences between species. Not just one species, but multiples. All so that I can distill the distinctive similarities between creatures of a certain type.<PAGE>Because all of these animals share similarities, I have dubbed this type of infusion "Similitudo", Similarity, the same way I gave the aspects their name.<LINE>I might as well start with the least dangerous animals. Those that are typically found on a farm.
research.SIMILITUDOINFUSIONS.stage.2.text=I already have made a solid theory, yet it is far too early to go out on assumptions on whether or not I am correct. After all, lives are on the line.<BR>Speaking of line, the next IN line are the undead creatures.
research.SIMILITUDOINFUSIONS.stage.3.text=It appears that my theory may have been incomplete, but not completely false. Certain similarities are already showing. Now that I have looked at the living and unliving beasts, it is time to look at the rest.<BR>What are the rest? The human, the alien and the constructs!<BR>This will be no easy task...
research.SIMILITUDOINFUSIONS.stage.4.text=I went the extra mile, made sure everything was correct and never stopped in the face of certain failure. It paid off and it shows.<BR>Life is no more an enigma to me than the flow of water. Life, Unlife, I have become the master of both. The only thing missing is now is death.<BR>But now that my knowledge about creatures is vast beyond measure, I will have very little trouble finishing the infusions that I have already thought up. New ones shouldn't be hard to go through either.

research.INSTILLEDFIDELITY.title=Instilled Fidelity
research.INSTILLEDFIDELITY.stage.1.text=It is a little bit tedious to tame every animal that I wish as my companion, and bottling them up to-go is just so much easier.<BR>So now I will have to study the taming process to find out how I can replicate it.
research.INSTILLEDFIDELITY.stage.2.text=With the aid of Thaumaturgy, I can ignore the process of taming a wild beast and simply infuse the loyalty right into their feral and malleable minds.<BR>Unfortunately, it only works on those, that actually can be tamed in the first place.

research.SELFSHEARING.title=Self Shearing
research.SELFSHEARING.stage.1.text=As marvelous as the shear may appear, it is time for me to upgrade.<BR>And what better way to use my curative vat and my infusion matrix in conjunction?
research.SELFSHEARING.stage.2.text=With the Auto-Shear ability, any mob that can be sheared will toss aside their bothersome coat, once it is ready to be sheared. <BR>The break of dawn for nudist sheep has come!

research.wheatdupe.title=Cultivation
research.wheatdupe.stage.0=While inanimate matter is easy enough to modify through alchemy, living things seldom survive the process. Your recent work has taken a somewhat different tack - instead of attempting to modify plants, you have simply used alchemy to accelerate their natural life cycle.
research.wheatdupe.stage.1=While inanimate matter is easy enough to modify through alchemy, living things seldom survive the process. Your recent work has taken a somewhat different tack - instead of attempting to modify plants, you have simply used alchemy to accelerate their natural life cycle.<BR>By soaking the seeds of common food crops in the concentrated essence of light, water, and soil, plants can be grown with astonishing speed. Unfortunately, this process takes its toll; the plants invariably die shortly after fruiting.

research.incubated.title=A chicken in every crucible
research.incubated.stage.0=After the success of alcheponics, applying a similar process to animals seems to be the logical next step.
research.incubated.stage.1=After the success of alcheponics, applying a similar process to animals seems to be the logical next step. Providing a chicken egg with warmth and raw life energy guarantees that the embryo within will survive when the egg is opened.<BR>Better yet, by limiting the process to the chicken's infancy, you seem to have solved the rapid aging which plagued your crops.
#
research.meatgrowth.title=Cruelty-free
research.meatgrowth.stage.0=You now have a solid understanding of how alchemy interacts with an organism's natural growth.
research.meatgrowth.stage.1=You now have a solid understanding of how alchemy interacts with an organism's natural growth. By selectively applying these techniques, you can propagate individual tissues without needing to grow the entire animal.<BR>The most obvious application of this discovery lies in food production - a small sample of raw meat can be grown to arbitrary size without losing its texture or flavor.
#
research.fleshharding.title=Shard Transmutation
research.fleshharding.stage.0=Despite your success at duplicating meat, growing usable skin has proven to be a more vexing problem.
research.fleshharding.stage.1=Despite your success at duplicating meat, growing usable skin has proven to be a more vexing problem. Now you may have discovered an alternate method of leather production.<BR>When boiled in the proper mixture of essentia, most varieties of flesh harden until they become indistinguishable from natural leather. You have even managed to transmute rotten zombie bits into a usable form, although in this case a dollop of §7Ordo§0 is needed to reverse their decay.
#
research.chococow.title=Chocolate Cow
research.chococow.stage.0=You have discovered a method of improving the common dairy cow.
research.chococow.stage.1=You have discovered a method of improving the common dairy cow.<BR>Alters the cow's udders to produce a syrupy chocolate milk. It can be consumed on its own for the usual effects of milk or dried into chocolate bars. With a pinch of magic you can also flash-freeze it to produce delicious ice cream.<BR>Some claim that by combining nine chocolate bars one can create a chocolate block, but what sort of deviant would use chocolate as a building material?
#
research.mobexchange.title=Monster's Exchanger
research.mobexchange.stage.0=Bovine infusion merges its organs with fungal matter to produce the exotic symbiont known as the Mooshroom.
research.mobexchange.stage.1=Bovine infusion merges its organs with fungal matter to produce the exotic symbiont known as the Mooshroom.<BR>Whether this proves that the Mooshroom is an artificial life-form crafted by ancient thaumaturges, or if you have simply replicated a natural phenomenon, is still an open question. Unlike other infused creatures, Mooshrooms breed true. You can also use this method for making turkey.
#
research.goldchicken.title=Golden Chicken
research.goldchicken.stage.0=Even the humble chicken holds great potential; it simply awaits the work of a clever thaumaturge.
research.goldchicken.stage.1=More impressively, you have discovered a method of performing alchemical reactions within a chicken. The golden eggs it lays can be smelted to produce a single gold nugget.<BR>It should be noted that the process is slow and gradual; killing the chicken which lays golden eggs will not reveal a stockpile of gold.
#
research.NETHERHOUND.title=Nether Hound
research.NETHERHOUND.stage.0=Finally, by infusing a tamed wolf with infernal energies, you can produce the deadly nether hound.
research.NETHERHOUND.stage.1=Finally, by infusing a tamed wolf with infernal energies, you can produce the deadly nether hound. Not only does this guard dog possess a vicious bite and immunity to heat, but it is capable of exhaling a jet of primal fire upon its enemies.<BR>It remains surprisingly friendly.
#
research.DOPESQUID.title=Squid Smoker
research.DOPESQUID.stage.0=You find it quite tedious to constantly fill a pipe with your own hands, but who will do it for you?
research.DOPESQUID.stage.1=You find it quite tedious to constantly fill a pipe with your own hands, but who will do it for you? Squids that live in the ocean spend their lives filtering water, and they are clearly capable of more than that.<BR>The squid will swim after the one who gives him fresh tobacco leaves, accompanying the owner of carcinogenic smoke. The greedy animal will not share with you for nothing, for each dose the owner must give a part of his mental poison.<BR>You can give the squid samples of desired tobacco flavors.
